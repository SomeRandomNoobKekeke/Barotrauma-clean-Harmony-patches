## What is this?
C# mod for Barotrauma that replaces Barotrauma code with identical Harmony patches

Designed to be used as template for other c# mods
## Why???
Because now i have 2 c# mods depending on similar set of methods, and i think it's easier to apply baro updates to this and then apply mod specific changes on top of that than apply baro updates in two places

And i can imagine other modders would want to skip monkey work and just copy paste this
## Why don't you just automate this?
Idk how
